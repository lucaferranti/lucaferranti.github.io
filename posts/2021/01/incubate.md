I am thrilled to announce that \elink{INCUBATE}{https://www.univaasa.fi/en/articles/small-satellites-can-provide-method-accurate-navigation-indoors-incubate-project-receives}, the new project on small satellites positioning led by the University of Vaasa, is starting in January 2021. My role in this project will be designing new accurate algorithms for small satellites based positioning. Exciting times ahead!

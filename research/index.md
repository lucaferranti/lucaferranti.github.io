@def title="Research"

Broadly speaking, my research interest lies in computational mathematics. I like to turn abstract math into practically working code
and apply it to different engineering domains, such as computer vision or positioning. I have particular experience with computational algebraic geometry and optimized polynomial solvers generation. Currently, I am working on numerical algorithms design for Low Earth Orbit satellites positioning.

@def title="Research"

Broadly speaking, my research interest lies in computational mathematics. I like to turn abstract math into working efficient code and apply it to solve real problems in various engineering domains, such as computer vision or positioning. I have particular experience with computational algebraic geometry and optimized polynomial solvers generation. My language-of-choice is Julia, but I am also comfortable with Python, Matlab, C and C++.
Currently, I am working on numerical algorithms design for Low Earth Orbit satellites positioning.

## Current teaching

- **Computer Vision**, 2021-, graduate level, University of Vaasa: responsible for exercises and assignment. I codesigned the course from scratches for its first implementation. I prepared the exercises and assignments material and model solutions for them.

## Previous teaching

- **Basic courses in Electrical Engineering**, 2017-2018, undergraduate level, Tampere University: I was the main teaching assistant responsible for exercise sessions of two core courses for the Electrical Engineering curriculum (circuit analysis and linear systems). I showed model solutions to some exercises and helped students in solving exercises themselves. I also maintained the course webpage and developed automatically graded exercises on it. My teaching methods receive extremely positive feedback from students.
